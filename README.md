Hello, I'm @mshoenberger. Thank you for dropping by!

I am interested in becoming a computer scientist over the new few years of my Mater's program!

************************************************************************************************

Right now I am learning

    1) Data Structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hashtables/Dictionaries, Trees, Graphs)

    2) Algorithms

I hope to work hard and move my knowledge far enough where I can learn about machine learning and computer vision
